# Procell

Processing 2D game project


### Running Procell #

Binary files for your OS are available in the corresponding folder.
The Java archive can be found in the lib folder, along with required librairies.
The application can also be launched within the Processing IDE by just opening Procell.pde.

### Playing with Procell #

When the game is launched, just type the keyword you want on it. It can either be a Hashtag, a Twitter username, or just a word/sentance of your choice.
Twitter will generaly return results, but if you choose an expression nobody uses (example : "shkqskhdq"), the generated result will be empty.
You can now discover the environnement, filled with tweet-related entities.
